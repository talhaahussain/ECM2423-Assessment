# ECM2423-Assessment
Continuous Assessment for ECM2423 - Artificial Intelligence and Applications, set by Prof. Ayah Helal. Involves the use of several search algorithms for the problem of solving mazes, as well as comparing performance and an independent extra program for generating new mazes.

bfs.py, dfs.py and maze_generator.py all contain an interactive main program, from which instructions on usage and options are provided. bfs.py and dfs.py also contain analysis options, which analyse the performance of the algorithms based on direction biases, which can be used to determine the biases of a given maze.

maze_generator.py is code from a legacy project of mine, adapted to work with the formatting of this project.
